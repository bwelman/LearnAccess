Access, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word are standalone programs for many users. For many business applications, a collaboration between the programs is important. And there are plenty of options for that.

## About integration of Office applications {#sec-integration-about}

The individual programs within the Microsoft Office package can work well together so that integration within processes is possible. However, for many users, Access, Excel, and Word are separate programs, each with their strong and weak sides. Access for databases, Excel for the calculations, and Word for word processing.

Access can export data from tables, queries, and forms to Excel, so you can do there the calculations that are not possible in Access. Besides, Acess can import data from Excel worksheets.

Access can also export from tables, queries, and forms to a Word RTF file. Additionally, an Access database can serve as a data source when creating default letters and labels in Word through the wizard. This wizard can be started from both Access and Word.
