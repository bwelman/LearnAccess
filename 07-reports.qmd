Reports are overviews that are usually meant for printing. Also, labels are a form of reports.

## About creating reports {#sec-reports-about}

Reports are usually overviews and summaries of large amounts of information.

If you want to print a sales report clearly on paper, then you use a report. In a report, you can also calculate subtotals and grand totals. You can create reports by hand, but it's easier to use the Wizard.

Reports can be dynamically by using parameters. When generating the report you will be prompted for additional information. As an example see report [Sales per box]{.uicontrol}. When opening this report you are asked to enter a start date and after that for an end date.

## Creating Labels {#sec-reports-labels}

How to create labels with the Wizard.

In this task, you are going to create address labels for the customers with the Label Wizard. First, you have to select the table with the necessary fields.

::: {#prp-reports-labels}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1. Open the database.

2.  Select table [Customers]{.uicontrol}.

3.  Choose [tab Create \> Labels (group Reports]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Select measures `Metric`, manufacturer `Avery` and then product `Avery L7160`, see @fig-label-wizard-avery7160.

![Selection label type Avery L7160.](images/reports/label-wizard-avery7160.png){#fig-label-wizard-avery7160}

5.  Click [Next]{.uicontrol}. In the screen that is displayed now, you can change font and color for the text.

6.  Accept the default settings and click [Next]{.uicontrol}.

![Data on the label.](images/reports/label-wizard-fields.png){#fig-label-wizard-fields}

::: {.callout-note}
By double-clicking on a field name, the field is inserted at the cursor location. You can also use button [\>]{.uicontrol}. The field name appears between brackets on the prototype label. Also, text and spaces can be typed. With the Enter button, you can create a new line.
:::

7.  Create the following prototype label (with 1 space between the first and last name, and 2 spaces between zip code and city):

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    {FirstName} {LastName}
    {Address}
    {ZipCode} {City}

8.  Click op [Next]{.uicontrol}. In the screen that is displayed now you can specify if the labels should be sorted, and if so, by which fields.

9.  There must be sorted by [ZipCode]{.varname}. Add this field and click [Next]{.uicontrol}. The last screen of the Wizard is displayed now. Here you can specify the name for the report.

10. Name the report [Labels Customers]{.varname} and click [Finish]{.uicontrol}.

![Print Preview.](images/reports/report-customers-printpreview.png){#fig-report-customers-printpreview}

11. Close the report.
:::

## Generated report {#sec-reports-autoreport}

Access can automatically generate a report based on a table or a query. Sometimes the generated report is sufficient, but mostly you need to make manual adjustments.

::: {#prp-reports-autoreport}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1. Open the database.

2.  Select query [Sales per region per box]{.uicontrol}.

3.  Click [tab Create \> Report (group Reports)]{.uicontrol}. The report is generated and opened in [Layout View]{.uicontrol}.

It's not beautiful that the value of [Region]{.varname} is repeated for each record and that the Sales values are not properly formatted. In the following steps, this will be changed.

4.  Close the report and answer the question to save the changes with [Yes]{.uicontrol}. The dialog box ***Save As*** is displayed.

5.  Name the report [Sales per region per box]{.varname} and click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

6.  Open the report [Sales per region per box]{.uicontrol} in [Design View]{.uicontrol}.

7.  Select in section [Detail]{.uicontrol} the field [Region]{.uicontrol}. In the [Property Sheet]{.uicontrol} change the value of property [Hide Duplicates]{.uicontrol} in `Yes`.

::: {.callout-note}
The [Property Sheet]{.uicontrol} is on the right side of the screen and can be made visible and invisible by clicking on button [Property Sheet]{.uicontrol} or by using hotkey [F4]{.uicontrol}.
:::

8.  Select in section [Detail]{.uicontrol} the field [Sales]{.varname}. In the [Property Sheet]{.uicontrol} set the value of property [Format]{.uicontrol} on `Currency`.

9.  Switch to [Report View]{.uicontrol}. The value of field [Region]{.varname} is now displayed only once and the sales values are in currency format.

10. Close the report and save the changes.

## Report with grouping {#sec-reports-grouping}

INFORMATION NEEDS

:   Create a report which shows over a specified period the sales per box, as well as the details of each order. As an example, see @fig-group-report-result which shows part of the report for November 2009.

![Report November 2009 (partial view).](images/reports/group-report-result.png){#fig-group-report-result}

ANALYSIS

The required data are [BoxName]{.varname}, [OrderCode]{.varname}, [OrderDate]{.varname}, [Quantity]{.varname}, and a calculated field [Sales]{.varname} from the expression `[Quantity]*[BoxPrice]`. A query for this data is already available with the name [Sales per box per order per period]{.varname}.

::: {#prp-reports-grouping}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1. Open the database.

2.  Select query [Sales per box per order per period]{.varname}.

3.  Choose [tab Create \> Report Wizard (group Reports)]{.uicontrol}.

![Specifying fields.](images/reports/group-wizard-fields.png){#fig-group-wizard-fields}

4.  Add all query fields, then click [Next]{.uicontrol}. In the screen that is displayed now, you can specify if you want to add grouping levels.

5.  Remove existing grouping levels ([OrderCode]{.varname}) and add [BoxName]{.varname} as grouping level

![Specifying fields for grouping.](images/reports/group-wizard-levels.png){#fig-group-wizard-levels}

6.  Click [Next]{.uicontrol}. In the screen that is displayed now, you can specify the sort order.

7.  Specify to sort ascending on [OrderCode]{.varname}.

![Specifying sort order and summary information.](images/reports/group-wizard-sort.png){#fig-group-wizard-sort}

8.  Click button [Summary Options...]{.uicontrol} and select that the Sum should be calculated for the fields [Quantity]{.varname} and [Sales]{.varname}.

![Specifying calculated summary values.](images/reports/group-wizard-summary.png){#fig-group-wizard-summary}

9.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol} and after that [Next]{.uicontrol}. Now you can specify the layout of the report.

10. Select [Outline]{.uicontrol} layout.

![Layout report.](images/reports/group-wizard-layout.png){#fig-group-wizard-layout}

11. Click [Next]{.uicontrol}. The last screen of the Wizard is displayed now. Here you can specify the name for the report.

12. Name the report [Sales per box per order per period]{.varname} and click [Finish]{.uicontrol}.

The report is created and displayed in [Print Preview]{.uicontrol}. Because the query has parameters for the start and end date, you should enter values for these parameters.

13. Test with Start date `11/1/2009` and End date `11/30/2009`.

14. Close the report.

## Praline Pictures {#sec-reports-pictures}

In this task, you create a report with pictures of the pralines and the code and name above it. For that, labels are used, and on each label the data of the praline.

::: {#prp-reports-pictures}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1. Open the database.

2.  Select table [Pralines]{.uicontrol}.

3.  Choose [tab Create \> Labels (group Reports)]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Select measures `Metric`, manufacturer `Zweckform` and then product `Zweckform 3415`.

![Label type Zweckform 3415.](images/reports/label-wizard-zweckform3415.png){#fig-label-wizard-zweckform3415}

5.  Click [Next]{.uicontrol}. In the screen that is displayed now, you can change font and color for the text.

6.  Accept the default settings and click [Next]{.uicontrol}.

7.  Create the following Prototype label ( with 1 space between the fields):

        {PralineCode} {PralineName}

8.  Click [Next]{.uicontrol}. Specify to sort by [PralineCode]{.varname}.

9.  Click [Next]{.uicontrol}. Name the report [Labels Pralines]{.varname}.

10. Click [Finish]{.uicontrol}. The report is generated and displayed in [Print Preview]{.uicontrol}.

11. Switch to [Design View]{.uicontrol}.

12. Click op [tab Design \> Bound Object Frame (group Controls)]{.uicontrol} ![](images/common/control-bound-object-frame.png) and draw a rectangle of approximately 1 inch by 1 inch in the [Detail]{.uicontrol} section.

![Object frame.](images/reports/label-praline-objectframe.png){#fig-label-praline-objectframe}

13. Make sure the frame remains selected, and then apply through the [Property Sheet]{.uicontrol} the following changes:

-   In tab [Format]{.uicontrol}: set Width and Height on 1 inch. Access may adjusts the dimensions a little bit. That's no problem.

![Frame dimensions.](images/reports/label-praline-dimensions.png){#fig-label-praline-dimensions}

-   In tab \[Data\]{.uicontrol: specify for property [Control Source]{.uicontrol} field `Picture`.

![Control Source.](images/reports/label-praline-controlsource.png){#fig-label-praline-controlsource}

14. Select the label which is located substantially behind the frame.

![Selecting label.](images/reports/label-praline-label.png){#fig-label-praline-label}

15. Remove the label with the [Delete]{.uicontrol} key.

16. Switch to [Print Preview]{.uicontrol}.

It is now almost good. Only the images don't all start at the same height so that the representation is chaotic. The text of [PralineCode]{.varname} and [PralineName]{.varname} should get a fixed height so that all images are placed at the same height.

17. Switch to [Design View]{.uicontrol}, select the text box and set property [Height]{.uicontrol} on 0.4 inch. Set also the properties [Can Grow]{.uicontrol} and [Can Shrink]{.uicontrol} on `No`.

![Properties text box.](images/reports/label-praline-textbox.png){#fig-label-praline-textbox}

18. Align text box and frame to the left.

![Align controls.](images/reports/label-praline-alignment.png){#fig-label-praline-alignment}

19. Switch to [Print Preview]{.uicontrol}.

![Print preview pralines.](images/reports/report-pralines-result.png){#fig-report-pralines-result}

20. Close the report and save the changes.

![](images/reports/rapp001-report.png)
:::

::: {#exr-rapp002}
**Sales per box per region (rapp002)**

Create a report with per box the sales per region. Name the report [rapp002]{.varname}.

![](images/reports/rapp002-report.png)
:::

::: {#exr-rapp003}
**Box and PralineCosts (rapp003)**

Create a report that shows all pralines in each box, together with the costs of these pralines. Also, display the sum of all praline costs. Name the report [rapp003]{.varname}.

![](images/reports/rapp003-report.png)
:::

::: {#exr-rapp004}
**Box and Praline costs grouped (rapp004)**

Create a copy of the report [rapp003]{.varname} and name the copy [rapp004]{.varname}. Make the report more legible to print all data of a box on a separate page. This can be done by inserting a page break before the header of each group. You need to set the property Force New Page of the groupheader with the value Before Section.

Furthermore, make some small changes to the layout. The text box Sum should be moved to the right with only a small horizontal line above the sum.

![](images/reports/rapp004-report.png)

`r hide("Tip")` Every box is a group, so the group header in this report is named Box Header. `r unhide()`
:::

::: {#exr-rapp005}
**Sales per box per order per period (rapp005)**

Create a copy of the report [Sales per box per order per period]{.varname} and name the copy [rapp005]{.varname}. Change the design of the report so that the total amount per box is printed next to the name box.
